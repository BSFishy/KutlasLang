# KutlasLang
This is the Kutlas language repository

### What is KutlasLang?
Kutlas Lang is the language repository for Kutlas. What this means, is that it is the brains behind the whole operation. It reads the files, parses them, and runs them.

### How would I run this?
Kutlas Lang has a main file here: [https://github.com/mttprvst13/KutlasLang/blob/master/src/com/lousylynx/kutlas/lang/KutlasLang.java](link). You can compile the code, and run it with the argument leading to where the file to be read is(relative to your current directory). Another option, is to use IntellIJ Idea's builtin java program runner, and setup the argument, to "compile" it, and run it automatically

### What if I want to help?
I am always looking for help. This is definitely not a one man operation. If you want to help, create your own branch, and push your code there. Once you have some code that works, you can submit a pull request. If I see nothing wrong with your changes, I will accept them. If I see you actively working on this project, I will add you to the contributors list, so you can add code, without having to submit a pull request.
